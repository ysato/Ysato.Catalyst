# The --action-offline-mode flag runs actions using locally cached content and Docker images only.
# If an action's content or its required Docker image is not already present locally,
# running with this flag will result in an error, as it avoids all network access.
# To ensure offline mode works, first run act without this flag to cache necessary resources.
